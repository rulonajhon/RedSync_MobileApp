# HemoAssist Content Filtering Test Results

## Overview
This document demonstrates how HemoAssist's content filtering ensures responses stay focused on hemophilia-related topics only.

## Content Filtering Implementation

### 1. Pre-Processing Filter
- **Function**: `_isHemophiliaRelated(String prompt)`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user input before sending to AI
- **Keywords Monitored**: 100+ hemophilia-related terms including:
  - Medical terms: hemophilia, bleeding, factor, clotting, coagulation
  - Symptoms: joint pain, swelling, bruising, nosebleeds
  - Treatments: factor VIII/IX, prophylaxis, infusion, concentrate
  - Lifestyle: exercise, sports, diet, nutrition, travel
  - Support: insurance, support groups, family concerns

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt
- **Strict Instructions**: AI explicitly told to ONLY answer hemophilia questions
- **Content Restrictions**: No general medical advice, entertainment, or unrelated topics
- **Response Guidelines**: Must include safety disclaimers and healthcare provider consultation reminders

### 3. Post-Processing Validation
- **Function**: `_isResponseAppropriate(String response)`
- **Purpose**: Validates AI response contains hemophilia-relevant content
- **Fallback**: Returns standard redirect message if response is off-topic

### 4. Standard Off-Topic Response
When non-hemophilia questions are detected, users receive:
```

I can assist you with:
